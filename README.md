Real Time MIT Campus Bus Stops and Tracker


In this project I was tasked with getting the real time locations of the MIT Campus Bus system along with bus stops. I was able to get the info from MIT's tracker website and updated the map accordingly with the respective markers.

Blue markers - Real Time Bus Trackers

Red Markers - Bus Stop Locations.

How to run: Go to tron-stack.github.io/Bus-Repo and watch the markers.

Future Improvements: More detailed markers, add other university bus systems, Route maps.

Licensing: free to use as you see fit.
